# MuleSoft Lightning Web Components

This repository contains code that can be used to demonstrate how Salesforce Lightning Web Components can be used as a frontend for APIs delivered with Mule.  Currently there are 2 generic components for demonstration:<br/>
	1) Related Info View (Single Record)<br/>
		- Use this to display a table of key value pairs.  This is best for displaying a single related record or a list of related information.<br/>
	2) Related Table View (Multi/Child Records)<br/>
		- Use this to display a table of related values.  This is best for displaying a list of related records.<br/>
